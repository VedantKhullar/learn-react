export const ABOUT_TEXT = `Hi, I'm Vedant, a passionate and curious Software Engineer with over 3.5 years of experience crafting impactful web applications. My expertise lies in frontend technologies like React and Angular, where I've built intuitive, high-performing interfaces using JavaScript and TypeScript. While frontend is my forte, I've also had the opportunity to work with Node.js and Python, adding a touch of versatility to my full-stack skillset. Outside of coding, I'm an avid explorer. I love discovering new places, cultures, and perspectives—whether that's through a spontaneous trip to a new city or trying out something completely unfamiliar. I also enjoy reading from time to time, particularly non-fiction that broadens my mind. I'm someone who enjoys trying new things and continuously learning, and I bring that same mindset into my work. Whether it's learning a new programming language, exploring new development frameworks, or experimenting with new hobbies, I believe in always growing and evolving.If you're passionate about innovation and making an impact, let's connect—I'd love to collaborate and share ideas!`;
